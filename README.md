Flight Delay Prediction Project
This project leverages machine learning to predict flight delays, providing valuable insights for travelers, airlines, and operational planning. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of historical flight information, we aim to forecast potential delays, enabling proactive decision-making and improved travel experiences.

Flight delays are a common occurrence, leading to significant inconvenience for passengers, increased operational costs for airlines, and environmental impact. Accurate delay predictions can:

Empower Passengers: Allow travelers to adjust their schedules, plan alternatives, or make informed decisions about their journeys.
Optimize Airline Operations: Enable airlines to better manage resources, re-route flights, re-assign crews, and minimize the ripple effects of delays across their network.
Enhance Air Traffic Control: Provide insights for more efficient air traffic management and reduce congestion.

Our solution employs various machine learning models trained on a rich dataset that includes factors such as:
Departure and arrival times
Origin and destination airports
Airline carriers
Flight distances
Historical delay patterns
(Potentially) Weather conditions, air traffic volume, etc.
Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, we've developed a predictive system designed to identify the likelihood of a flight being delayed.
